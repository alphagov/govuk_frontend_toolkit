# GOV.UK frontend toolkit

---

#### You can help us improve the GOV.UK frontend toolkit by completing our [5 minute survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/2MZRS9H).

---

A collection of Sass and JavaScript files for using as part of your
application's frontend.

This project is not tied to a specific language and is designed to be used
as a dependency in as many different languages as needed.

There's a `Gemfile` and a `package.json` in this directory, but they are only
for running tests and are not an indication that this project prefers
Ruby or Node.js.

## Installing

### Ruby on Rails

We recommend you use the [govuk_frontend_toolkit_gem][toolkit_gem_github] and
follow the [installation instructions][toolkit_gem_github_readme].

[toolkit_gem_github]: https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit_gem
[toolkit_gem_github_readme]: https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit_gem#readme

### Node.js

[govuk_frontend_toolkit_npm][toolkit_npm_github] is an NPM package that can be
[installed or included in your package.json][toolkit_npm].

[toolkit_npm_github]: https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit_npm
[toolkit_npm]: https://npmjs.org/package/govuk_frontend_toolkit

If you are using a build tool that depends on Libsass then you
may need to upgrade to a more recent version to use the grid helpers. Minimal
compatible versions include `node-sass` 1.0.0, `grunt-sass` 0.16.0,
`gulp-sass` 1.2.0 and `libsass` 3.0.0.

### Composer

[govuk_frontend_toolkit_composer][toolkit_composer_github] is an composer package that can be
[added to your composer.json][toolkit_composer_github_usage]

[toolkit_composer_github]: https://github.com/PurpleBooth/govuk_frontend_toolkit_composer
[toolkit_composer_github_usage]: https://github.com/PurpleBooth/govuk_frontend_toolkit_composer#installing

### Other projects

#### Using the tagged versions

Each version of the toolkit is tagged with the version number in this format:

`v*version number*`, for example `v4.1.1` for version 4.1.1.

If your dependency management tool allows the use of Git repositories as dependencies, you can point to a version by using its tag.

For example, if you are using [bower](http://bower.io), you can add the toolkit to your `bower.json` like so:

`"govuk_frontend_toolkit": "git://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit#v4.1.1"` (assuming you want version 4.1.1)

#### Using git submodules

You can include the toolkit as a [git submodule][https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules].

[git submodule]: https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-submodule.html

To add the submodule to your project run the following command substituting the path to a subdirectory in your project's assets directory:

    $ git submodule add https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_frontend_toolkit.git ./path/to/assets/govuk_frontend_toolkit

We recommend you use `https` rather than `ssh` for submodules as they don't require key exchanges when deploying to remote servers.

If you clone a project with the toolkit submodule installed you will need to initialise the submodule with the following command:

    $ git submodule init

To update the toolkit to the latest version you can use:

    $ git submodule update

## Running tests

Tests for this project use Jasmine for the JavaScript and Ruby's `scss` and `scss-lint`
to check the stylesheets.

The requirements are Node.js 0.8 or higher and PhantomJS, and Ruby:

```bash
bundle install
npm install
npm test
```

### Standard JavaScript
`govuk_frontend_toolkit` uses [standardjs](http://standardjs.com/), an opinionated JavaScript linter.
All JavaScript files follow its conventions. [Read more](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_prototype_kit/blob/master/docs/linting.md)

### Using the local test runner

The test suite can be run by opening the `./spec/support/LocalTestRunner.html` file in a browser for a more detailed trace of errors.

The files for unit tests and any supporting JavaScript should be added to `./spec/manifest.js` file.

## Usage

At the top of a Sass file in your project you should use an `@import` rule
to include the file for the mixins you require, eg if you want the
conditionals and typography mixins you should add:

    @import '_conditionals';
    @import '_typography';

You may need to include the relative path to the toolkit if it is installed as a submodule:

    @import '../toolkit/_conditionals';

If you are compiling Sass from the [command-line tool](http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#using_sass), here are some options we recommend.

In development:

    sass --style expanded --line-numbers --load-path [path to]/govuk_frontend_toolkit/stylesheets input.scss output.css

In production:

    sass --style compressed --load-path [path to]/govuk_frontend_toolkit/stylesheets input.scss output.css
