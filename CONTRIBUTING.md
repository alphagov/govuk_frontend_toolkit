# Contribution Guidelines

We welcome patches to the toolkit, as long as you follow these
guidelines:

## Indentation and whitespace

2-space, soft-tabs only. No trailing whitespace.

## Versioning

We use [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/), and bump the version
on master only. Please don't submit your own proposed version numbers.

## Commit hygiene

Please see our [git style guide](https://github.com/alphagov/styleguides/blob/master/git.md)
which describes how we prefer git history and commit messages to read.
